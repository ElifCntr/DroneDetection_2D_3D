# src/detection/optimization/scoring.py

"""
Optimization-scoring module.

Defines a loss function for grid search that balances detection rate against
average proposal count.

Loss formula:
    L = -alpha * det_rate + beta * avg_props

Where:
  - det_rate  : fraction of ground-truth frames correctly detected (IoU â‰¥ threshold)
  - avg_props : average number of proposals per frame
  - alpha     : weight for detection rate (higher => prioritize detection)
  - beta      : weight for proposal count (higher => penalize more proposals)
